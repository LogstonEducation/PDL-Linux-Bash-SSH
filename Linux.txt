What is an Operating System?

    - A suite of software that allows for managment of hardware
        - CPU
        - RAM
        - HDD
        - Internet
        - Keybaord
        - etc
    - We ask the OS for memory to run our program and the OS does the talking
      to hardware.
    - We ask for information to be sent to Google over our NIC, the OS will
      take our stream of data and send it over network.
    - We talk to the operating system, and the operating system talks to the
      hardware, hardware talks to the OS and then the OS talks back to us.
    - The OS creates this level playing field for our software. Now our
      software can run on all types of hardware, we just need to make sure our
      software can run on the OS and the hardware talk is the OS's problem.

All the different versions of Linux combine the linux kernal (the bare bones OS
needed to run a machine) and some userland software (ie. software over and
above the kernal that adds functionality to the machine) (eg. email
applications, browsers, desktop window manager (of which there are tons: 42
best window managers*))
