SSH, or Secure Shell, is a shell opened on a remote computer.

How does it work?

You tell ssh what user you want to log in as and on what computer on the
internet (or intranet):

ssh <user>@<host>:<port (usually 22)>

So what's the secure part?

Symetric Key
Symetirc Key Cipher
Asymetirc Key
    Public Key - Everyone gets this, can not even decrypt its own messages
    Private Key - Kept private, only the owner of the pair can see this.

As part of the symmetrical encryption negotiation outlined above, a message
authentication code (MAC) algorithm is selected. The algorithm is chosen by
working through the client's list of acceptable MAC choices. The first one out
of this list that the server supports will be used.
